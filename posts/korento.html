    <h2>Delta Wings</h2>
    <p class="post-p">
        Me and my friend Tuukka designed and 3d printed canard delta wings for a fixed-wing drone.
        We used Fusion 360 for modelling, PrusaSlicer for brim and other parameters, and Prusa XL for printing.
        With our specific airfoil and wing design we tried to minimize the weight and surface thickness of the wings while still keeping them as durable/robust as possible.
        As a composite material we used PETG because we found out that it gave the best print quality to price ratio by far.
        The weight of a single wing was only about 50 grams, the span of one wing is 20 centimeters and the wing root is 29 centimeters.
        Here are the real-world and CAD model results:
