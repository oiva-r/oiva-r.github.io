<h3><strong>Linux & Git</strong> by Linus Torvalds — 1991/2005</b></h3>
<p class="post-p">
    The inspiration for this listing of "the greatest open-source software contributions from Finland" came from working with Git.
    I was trying to learn the more advanced features of Git and understand how they work.
    And every time it just blows my mind how elegantly Git was designed.
    Torvalds created the first version of Git just in 10 days [1].
    How could such a complex software problem be solved with principles this excellent in such a short time?
    How could a one man, a one mind, come up with both: Git and Linux?
    I think it's because Torvalds is one of the greatest foundational software thinkers of our time.
    He has had the best foundational ideas and visions for his projects from the very beginning.
    I obviously know that there have been a lot of other early developers in both projects.
    These people also deserve the recognition for their hard work. 
    Modern versions of Linux and Git are the accomplishment of thousands of very devoted core developers, nobody should forget that.
    But just the fact that the same Finnish man, Torvalds, initiated two of the greatest software projects that the humankind has ever witnessed is astonishing to me!
    Linux (and even Git) might not be perfect, and some of the present-day criticisms are valid, but when taking into account the practical relevancy and proportional complexity of both projects, I truly believe what I said in the previous sentence holds true!
    It makes me proud to be Finnish and also inspires me to create something valuable to the world.
    <blockquote>
        <i>“So I'd like to stress that while it really came together in just about ten days or so (at which point I did my first *kernel* commit using git),
        it wasn't like it was some kind of mad dash of coding.
        The actual amount of that early code is actually fairly small, it all depended on getting the basic ideas right.
        And that I had been mulling over for a while before the whole project started.
        I'd seen the problems others had. I'd seen what I wanted to avoid doing.”

<h3><strong>SSH</strong> by Tatu Ylönen — 1995</h3>
<p class="post-p">
    One of the most useful remote communication protocols that almost every programmer has used is the Secure Shell protocol (SSH).
    It was important replacement for telnet.
    Telnet was vulnerable to the interception of unencrypted packets from network traffic by sending everything in plaintext, but SSH changed this by providing encrypted communication between a client and server.
    Actually the inspiration for creating SSH came from Ylönen himself being targeted by a password sniffer in his university network (Helsinki University of Technology).
    Originally Ylönen provided the protocol specification [2] and also programmed the first implementation of SSH!
    This was a very important advancement in the history of communication via internet (network of networks), in a time when many networks were still isolated from the internet.
    So it's sad to know that many Finns have never heard of Ylönen, and hopefully that can change!

<h3><strong>IRC</strong> by Jarkko Oikarinen — 1988</h3>
<p class="post-p">
    Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was created early on in internet's history: in 1988 by Jarkko Oikarinen at University of Oulu.
    IRC was one of the first real-time messaging protocols created for the internet.
    It allows communication between users in channels, which are similar to modern chatrooms.
    Today IRC has been mostly replaced by modern alternatives like Matrix and Discord, but IRC has strong legacy and some free and open-source software communities still use it.

<h3><strong>MySQL & MariaDB</strong> by Michael Widenius et al. — 1995/2009</h3>
<p class="post-p">
    MySQL was one of the first open-source database systems.
    It was created in 1995, a time when large and expensive proprietary enterprise database systems dominated the scene.
    It pioneered the open-source database model, making reliable database technology accessible to everyone.
    MySQL was originally an important reason for the change in the database scene, leading to the prevalence of open-source databases and their increased popularity among developers.
    A famous example of this is the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP), which is one of the oldest and most popular software stacks used by developers around the world.
    LAMP stack powered much of early web and many servers on the internet still run on this stack today!
    When MySQL was sold to Oracle in 2010, Michael Widenius forked the project and created MariaDB as its successor.
